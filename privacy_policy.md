## Your Privacy

WalkWell is designed to respect your privacy by default. We collect only what is necessary to provide core app functionality.

This data is used only inside the app and is never shared or sold.

## Data Storage

Most data is stored locally on your device.  
Some non-personal content such as motivational messages and health articles may be fetched remotely.

## Analytics & Tracking

WalkWell does not use advertising trackers and does not track you across apps or websites.

## Payments

All purchases are handled securely by Apple through the App Store.  
WalkWell does not store payment information.

## Your Control

You can revoke Health permissions at any time via:
Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices → WalkWell

Deleting the app removes all locally stored data.
